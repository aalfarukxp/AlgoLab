📌 What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end of the list.

Sorting `[5, 3, 8, 4]`:

Compare 5 & 3 → swap → [3, 5, 8, 4]

Compare 5 & 8 → no swap → [3, 5, 8, 4]

Compare 8 & 4 → swap → [3, 5, 4, 8]

➡️ After first pass, 8 is in the correct place.
Repeat until sorted → [3, 4, 5, 8] ✅
