Implement a function that performs a selection sort. The function should take in an array of integers and return an array with the integers sorted in ascending order.

`selectionSort([9, 3, 6, 2, 1, 11]); output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11]`

`selectionSort([12, 16, 14, 1, 2, 3]); output: [1, 2, 3, 12, 14, 16]`
